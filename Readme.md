# Stasher

Stasher is a backend web application which automates the process of investing
and managing assets. You begin by declaring your income, savings percent,
desired allocations. Then, every day, stasher will buy investments like stocks,
money market funds, bitcoin, or more. It can rebalance into and out of savings
accounts, and then rebalance your portfolio in a tax-efficient manner.
